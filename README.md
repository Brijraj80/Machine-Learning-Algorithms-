# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
1) In this you can find the algorithms used in Machine Learning , if you are a beginner in ML then you must have a look at it all the algorithms are implemented in sklearn library 
2) The datasets on which alggorithms are tested are also provided 
3) Make sure you have libraries like pandas , numpy , sklearn installed in you IDE if not then just type "pip install libraryname" on the command prompt.
4) All this files can be directly executed in jupyter notebook 
5) You must have knowledge of python programming language and must have basic theoritical knowledge of algorithms to understand the code.
